															<p><strong>Zhaozheng Yin</strong> </p>
															<p>Zhaozheng Yin received his PhD in Computer Science and Engineering from Penn State in 2009, advised by Prof. Robert Collins, and received his Master and Bachelor degrees in University of Wisconsin-Madison and Tsinghua University where he worked with Prof. Yu Hen Hu and Prof. Li Cao, respectively. During his PhD study, he had summer internship with Dr. Cha Zhang (MSR) and Prof. Fatih Porikli (MERL). He also worked as a postdoctoral fellow at Carnegie Mellon University, in the Robotics Institute with Prof. Takeo Kanade during 2009-2011.
															</p>
															<p>Zhaozheng Yin has held his current position as Assistant Professor in Computer Science at Missouri S&T since September 2011. He is a recipient of CVPR Best Doctoral Spotlight Award (2009), MICCAI Young Scientist Award (2012, finalist in 2015 and 2010), NSF CAREER Award (2014), Department Outstanding Junior Faculty Research Award (2014) and Missouri S&T Faculty Research Award (2014), Best Paper Award of CVPR Workshop on Understanding Hands in Actions (2015). He is named as Daniel St. Clair Faculty Fellow in the Computer Science department in 2015.

															<p>Dr. <strong>Nathan Hotaling</strong> </p>
															<p>Dr. Nathan Hotaling received his Ph.D. from Biomedical Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, in 2013. He is currently working at NIH with Dr. Kapil Bharti and the National Eye Institute as an investigator of imaging methods to curing macular degeneration. He is interested in the fundamental role that biomaterials and their architecture play in influencing cell differentiation, immune response, and the long term clinical benefits as a result of implementing these materials and architectures. In order to gain an understanding of these interactions he is researching electrospun nanofiber PLGA scaffolds and their ability to support retinal pigment epithelium growth and differentiation from induced pluripotent stem cells. To do this he is systematically changing the physical properties of the PLGA scaffolds and monitoring changes in the retinal pigment epithelium. Overall, Nathan's research interests include 3D cell shape and differentiation, Cell-scaffold interactions biomaterials and tissue engineering, Stem cell/scaffold interactions, and Immunology & glycobiology.
