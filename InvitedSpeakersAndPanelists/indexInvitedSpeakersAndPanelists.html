															<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The data explosion by recording microscopy images during high throughput biological experiments makes the labor-intensive manual analysis prohibitive. Biologists need rigorous, quantitative and efficient approaches and tools to decipher complex biological processes. Since microscopy images differ from general natural scene images due to their specific image formation processes and the artifacts inherent in microscopy images cause difficulties or failures for many image processing methods, first, I will introduce the theoretical foundation of microscopy imaging optics. Then, the optics-related knowledge will be transferred to guide the development of microscopy image analysis algorithms and enhancement of microscope functionality. Finally, the algorithms will be integrated into practical tools capable of tracking and analyzing the behavior of specimens, therefore benefiting the community for biological discovery.

															<p><strong>Bio:</strong> Zhaozheng Yin received his PhD in Computer Science and Engineering from Penn State in 2009. After two-year postdoc training at Carnegie Mellon University, he joined Missouri S&T as an assistant professor in 2011. Currently, he is also a Daniel St. Clair Faculty Fellow in the Computer Science Department and a Dean’s Scholar in the College of Engineering and Computing. His group has been working in the field of Biomedical Image Analysis, Computer Vision and Machine Learning. He is a recipient of CVPR Best Doctoral Spotlight Award (2009), MICCAI Young Scientist Award (2012, finalist in 2015 and 2010), NSF CAREER Award (2014). He has been serving as an Area Chair of MICCAI2015, WACV2016 and CVPR2017.

															<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Microscopy could be an important tool for characterizing stem cell products if quantitative measurements could be collected over multiple spatial and temporal scales. With the cells changing states over time and being several orders of magnitude smaller than cell products, modern microscopes are already capable of imaging large spatial areas, repeat imaging over time, and acquiring images over several spectra. However, characterizing stem cell products from such large image collections is challenging because of data size, required computations, and lack of interactive quantitative measurements needed to determine release criteria. We present a measurement web system consisting of available algorithms, extensions to a client-server framework using Deep Zoom, and the configuration know-how to provide the information needed for inspecting the quality of a cell product. The cell and other data sets are accessible via the prototype web-based system at http://isg.nist.gov/deepzoomweb.

															<p><strong>Bio:</strong> Peter Bajcsy received his Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering in 1997 from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) and a M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering in 1994 from the University of Pennsylvania (UPENN).  He worked for machine vision, government contracting, and research and educational institutions before joining the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2011. At NIST, he has been leading a project focusing on the application of computational science in biological metrology, and specifically stem cell characterization at very large scales. Peter’s area of research is large-scale image-based analyses and syntheses using mathematical, statistical and computational models while leveraging computer science foundations for image processing, machine learning, computer vision, and pattern recognition. He has co-authored more than more than 34 journal papers and 9 books or book chapters, and close to 100 conference papers.

															<p>Dr. <strong>Nathan Hotaling</strong> </p>
															<p>Dr. Nathan Hotaling received his Ph.D. from Biomedical Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, in 2013. He is currently working at NIH with Dr. Kapil Bharti and the National Eye Institute as an investigator of imaging methods to curing macular degeneration. He is interested in the fundamental role that biomaterials and their architecture play in influencing cell differentiation, immune response, and the long term clinical benefits as a result of implementing these materials and architectures. In order to gain an understanding of these interactions he is researching electrospun nanofiber PLGA scaffolds and their ability to support retinal pigment epithelium growth and differentiation from induced pluripotent stem cells. To do this he is systematically changing the physical properties of the PLGA scaffolds and monitoring changes in the retinal pigment epithelium. Overall, Nathan's research interests include 3D cell shape and differentiation, Cell-scaffold interactions biomaterials and tissue engineering, Stem cell/scaffold interactions, and Immunology & glycobiology.
